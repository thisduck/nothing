    <h2>hallelujah - pages from zackeria's diary</h2>
    
  </header>
  <div id="post">
  <p>I was listening to the radio the other day and this song started to play. It was as if the song was speaking to me in such a way that it was about me. I wanted a chance to clarify/expand.</p>

<blockquote>Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?</blockquote>

<p>I care, I really do. Really. I care, but not in <em>that</em> way I'm afraid.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It goes like this<br>
The fourth, the fifth<br>
The minor fall, the major lift<br>
The baffled king composing Hallelujah</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had a noisy major lift at work. It was mainly used to transport large objects from the fourth to the fifth floor. I wouldn't call it a musical composition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your faith was strong but you needed proof<br>
You saw her bathing on the roof<br>
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my defense, I just wanted some fresh air. Not like it lasted long. She was quick to leave once she noticed me. I was mainly interested at how she was able to get all that plumbing up there anyway. I did later tell her it might not be the best thing to be bathing outside in mid-January. It gets real cold.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She tied you to a kitchen chair<br>
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair<br>
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, it didn't happen in that order. Again, I want to set the record straight on this one. I had <em>asked</em> her to give me a hair cut. So that's no big deal. But after that it got weird. IKEA never carried that kitchen chair again and that was my last bottle of hallelujah. I had been saving it for a while. It was one crazy night. If she had never asked me what I thought of the hair cut, I would have never told her. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Baby I have been here before<br>
I know this room, I've walked this floor<br>
I used to live alone before I knew you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing much changed after I knew you either. Still alone -- but my furniture is a lot safer now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've seen your flag on the marble arch<br>
Love is not a victory march<br>
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More like a death march, or a parade. A parade that veers off the designated path. Even the people leading it don't know where it's headed. Like that. And oh, it's broken alright. I will <em>never</em> get that kitchen chair back. There are some things that even super glue can't bond.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a time you let me know<br>
What's really going on below<br>
But now you never show it to me, do you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not after that bathing incident anyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And remember when I moved in you<br>
The holy dove was moving too<br>
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know, I don't even remember that. Were we drunk?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe there's a God above<br>
And all I ever learned from love<br>
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, so don't even try. I've been making regular trips to the shooting range... ever since that tying up incident.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's not a cry you can hear at night<br>
It's not somebody who's seen the light<br>
it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the hair cut was <em>that</em> bad. </p>
