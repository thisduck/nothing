Hi, I'm Adnan.

### what

This site is a collection of things I've written (sometimes in collaboration with others). It seemed like the thing to do.

I've selected certain writings from my blog to feature here. I hope what you find here resonates with you in some way.

This site was made through hours and hours of indecision.

### about

I do not believe in magic but I do believe in a pure state of astonishment, one that cannot only be witnessed by jaw drops, gasps, claps or silences, but one that I witness in your eyes. I believe in making people laugh and I believe in letting people cry. I believe that sushi and green tea are great any time of the day. I believe in fostering creativity, innovation and collaboration, but I don't believe in schedules. I believe in using things beyond what they were meant for. I believe in calling out bullshit, because life is too short for bullshit. I believe in being called out when I bullshit. I believe in failing and I believe in second and third chances.

I believe in good storytelling and word play. I believe that time travel is a fascinating concept. I believe in simplicity and I believe that simplicity requires thought. I believe that all jewelry is artificial. I believe in watching birds and snails and chasing butterflies and grasshoppers. I believe in drum beats and old Hindi songs. I believe in the Internet. I believe in acceptance over tolerance.

I also believe that chocolate is awesome.

### materials

A number of technologies went into the making of this site:

- [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) to get started
- [SimpleGrid](http://simplegrid.info/) for the responsive design
  capabilities
- [LessCSS](http://lesscss.org)
- [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for text
  formatting
- [Jekll](http://jekyllrb.com) to generate the HTML
- [Google's Web Fonts](http://google.com/webfonts)
- Vim, git, jQuery and the other usual suspects

I didn't test the site in Internet Explorer and do not care to do so.
