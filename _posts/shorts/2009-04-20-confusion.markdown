"I don't know", I said in response to his question.

"What do you mean you don't know?", he asked.

What does he mean about what I mean? Did I not know the meaning of what I said? Was I not clear? What more clarity could I shed beyond the words that I just said? What does <em>he</em> think it means when someone says 'I don't know'? Maybe he is not listening, maybe it is him who is not following the conversation.

"What?", I replied with the only word I could muster up.

"What do you mean you don't know?", he repeated himself, though this time a bit slower. 

"I didn't ask you to repeat yourself. I heard what you said. What do you mean when you ask me what I meant? Do you think I didn't know the meaning of what I said? Was I not clear? What more clarity could I shed beyond the words that I just said? What do <em>you</em> think it means when someone says 'I don't know'? Maybe you are not listening, maybe it is you who is not following the conversation. Maybe you are afraid of not knowing. I am not. And thus, I do not know."
