"You wanna switch?" asked Jack, genuinely concerned. It had been a few hours since Jill had started driving, "You seem a bit sleepy."

"Nah, I'm fine," replied Jill.

"You know, I saw a sign a few miles back and the word 'universe' stood out," said Jack, the wrinkled map in his hands. "We're just trying to get from point A to point B, and that word, 'universe', makes me want to look up at the sky. I see the stars. They're like dots to connect, you can find so many patterns and shapes, dippers and the like. It's fascinating, thousands of people through out time have used these same stars to navigate their way across cities, continents, and oceans around the world. 'Universe', you... neeeee... verse. Separate the 'u' into 'you', reverse the 'ni' to 'in' attach it to the 'verse' and you get 'you inverse'. 'Inverse', black to white and white to black, up to down and down to up. It's like the universe is telling us something. We're heading towards point B, but do you feel we should really be heading towards point A?"

"What? What in... what did... what exactly are you trying to say?"

"I think, my dear, that I misread the directions. We weren't supposed to take that right turn an hour ago, we're headed in the wrong direction."

Both, Jack and Jill, burst into laughter followed by a sudden silence. 

"Like I had said, we should have gotten the GPS. Oh, and by the way, I _am_ feeling sleepy," said Jill as she found a spot to pull over the car.
