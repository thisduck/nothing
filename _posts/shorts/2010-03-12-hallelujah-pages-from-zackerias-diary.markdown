I was listening to the radio the other day and this song started to play. It was as if the song was speaking to me in such a way that it was about me. I wanted a chance to clarify/expand.

<blockquote>Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?</blockquote>

I care, I really do. Really. I care, but not in <em>that</em> way I'm afraid.

> It goes like this
> The fourth, the fifth
> The minor fall, the major lift
> The baffled king composing Hallelujah

We had a noisy major lift at work. It was mainly used to transport large objects from the fourth to the fifth floor. I wouldn't call it a musical composition.

> Your faith was strong but you needed proof
> You saw her bathing on the roof
> Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

In my defense, I just wanted some fresh air. Not like it lasted long. She was quick to leave once she noticed me. I was mainly interested at how she was able to get all that plumbing up there anyway. I did later tell her it might not be the best thing to be bathing outside in mid-January. It gets real cold.

> She tied you to a kitchen chair
> She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
> And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Well, it didn't happen in that order. Again, I want to set the record straight on this one. I had <em>asked</em> her to give me a hair cut. So that's no big deal. But after that it got weird. IKEA never carried that kitchen chair again and that was my last bottle of hallelujah. I had been saving it for a while. It was one crazy night. If she had never asked me what I thought of the hair cut, I would have never told her. 

> Baby I have been here before
> I know this room, I've walked this floor
> I used to live alone before I knew you.

Nothing much changed after I knew you either. Still alone -- but my furniture is a lot safer now.

> I've seen your flag on the marble arch
> Love is not a victory march
> It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

More like a death march, or a parade. A parade that veers off the designated path. Even the people leading it don't know where it's headed. Like that. And oh, it's broken alright. I will <em>never</em> get that kitchen chair back. There are some things that even super glue can't bond.

> There was a time you let me know
> What's really going on below
> But now you never show it to me, do you?

Not after that bathing incident anyway.

> And remember when I moved in you
> The holy dove was moving too
> And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

You know, I don't even remember that. Were we drunk?

> Maybe there's a God above
> And all I ever learned from love
> Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you

Yeah, so don't even try. I've been making regular trips to the shooting range... ever since that tying up incident.

> It's not a cry you can hear at night
> It's not somebody who's seen the light
> it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Yes, the hair cut was <em>that</em> bad.
