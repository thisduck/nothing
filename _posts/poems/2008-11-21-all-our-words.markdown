if all your words were in a &lt;div&gt;
i would style them with &lt;em&gt;phasis
i would take even the weak points
and mark them &lt;strong&gt;
i would put them all front and centre
with {margin: 0px auto;}
and i would put around them
a blue dashed border with a width of one
though if all my words were in a &lt;div&gt;
i would style them with <span class="hideme"><a href="http://www.jaaduhai.com/blog/2008/11/21/all-our-words/">{display: none;}</a></span>

<script>
$(".hideme").hover(function() {$("div").hide()})
</script>
