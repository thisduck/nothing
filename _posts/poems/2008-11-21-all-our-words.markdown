if all your words were in a &lt;div&gt;
i would style them with &lt;em&gt;phasis
i would take even the weak points
and mark them &lt;strong&gt;
i would put them all front and centre
with {margin: 0px auto;}
and i would put around them
a blue dashed border with a width of one
though if all my words were in a &lt;div&gt;
i would style them with <span class="hideme"><a href="#">{display: none;}</a></span>

<script>
$(function() {
    $(".hideme").hover(function() {$("body").hide()})
});
</script>
