i like circles
circular motions
revolving doors
planetary rotations
i like circles
ferris wheels
and carousels
such dizzying notions
i like circles
the sun 
the moon
and what's in between
the stars i have not yet seen
i like circles
self-referential
circular references
things that end
in the same way
they begin
i like circles
