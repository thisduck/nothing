when the stepping stones
don't seem enough,
just follow the path
that <em>you</em> make
with each step.

then take a moment, or two --
glare at the empty sky,
and realize that
the shooting star
is a lonesome star.

dream as you might,
as many as you like,
as many as the night may give.
one step at a time, my dear,
is all you should ever take.
one breath at a time, my dear,
is all you should ever take.
