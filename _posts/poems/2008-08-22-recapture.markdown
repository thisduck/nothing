set, zoom, focus.
click, flash, snap.
done, stored, captured 
raw.

what then is missing?

the shutter speed,
the aperture f-stop,
all set for proper exposure.
the flash and the light,
they all seem so perfect,
they all seem so right.

then what is it that i am missing?
what is it that i want?
how, oh how, do i capture
a moment that is gone?
