tell me how you are.
but please, only a word or two.

then we can talk about the weather.
oh, it's so cold. oh, it's so sunny.
there. i've told you the weather
as if you didn't feel it on
your own skin.

okay, now let me talk about my
two year old for the next thirty
minutes and show you pictures.

and here we'll talk about something
the both of us are equally
indifferent towards.

i've always wanted to kill you,
and boring you to death is the
only legal way.
