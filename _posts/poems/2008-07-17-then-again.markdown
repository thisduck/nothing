i await a day
where with a clear mind
i can read a book
and then again
and then again
and then again
and maybe, then again

a day
where with a rocking rhythm
i can strum a chord
and then again
and then again
and then again
and maybe, then again

a day
where with my echoes
i can sing a song
and then again
and then again
and then again
and maybe, then again

a day
where with simple words
i can write
and then again
and then again
and then again
and maybe, then again

a night
where with the clouds, the stars, the moon
i can breathe
and then again
and then again
and then again
and maybe then ...
