and as much as we like to declare
what is wrong and what is right
the eyes can only see
as much as there is light.
so carry with yourself a flashlight
or a torch in your mind,
and turn it on
from time to time.
it's not surprising to be lost
driving without headlights
as we approach the night.
while you may even wander into the mystical deep,
a walk is not a walk when we walk while we sleep.
so...
it's okay.
it's okay to sleep now.
and it's okay to wake
every now and then.
