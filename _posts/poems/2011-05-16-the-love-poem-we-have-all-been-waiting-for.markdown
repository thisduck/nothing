tell me, my dear,
what has my love for you
done for you (lately)?

do you now shit and flush
rose buds down the commode?
the buds settling in the sewers
sending up rose scents
to passersby above?

tell me, my love,
about your eyes.
do you see any differently?
is your vision now 20/20?
has it turned spherical,
your astigmatic eye?

tell me about your
fear of heights,
your dizzy days,
your lazy nights.

tell me what you've
crossed off on your
list of dreams.
