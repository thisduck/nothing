i have no delusions
of light at the end of the tunnel.
i donâ€™t expect to get there.
god may have said,
"let there be light".
i say, "there need be none".
i have no delusions.
i roam in any direction
that my feet will lead me.
i carry nothing with me.
nothing here is mine.
only the journey...
maybe the journey is mine.
