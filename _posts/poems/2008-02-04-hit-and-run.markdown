these words, they hit and run,
words that hit, and don't sit
to see what happens next,
words that run, and miss out on the fun
and fear of judgement.

words that have no meaning,
so you make your own.
words that carry no feelings,
so you make your own.
words that don't tell you who I am,
so you make your own
me
