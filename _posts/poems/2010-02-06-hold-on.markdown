what the hell
is free verse?

this is why
poetry is such
a sham.

how in hell
can charles freaking
bu-
kows-
ki
take a couple
of (run-on)
sentences,

put
one, two
or three words
per line and
call it
poetry?

even kasparov has to
go the full distance
of the board
<em>every time</em>
before he can turn
a pawn into
a queen.

beauty, i suppose,
<em>is</em> in the eye
of the beholder.

it's just that
some of us
have to go through
many more eyes
before someone

holds on.
