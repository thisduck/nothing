out on my daily grind
in the dirt a puzzling find
two round buttons in the grass
the choice to make, to take or pass?

what do i do with the buttons in the dirt,
do i needle and sew, and mend my shirt?
or do i stick the buttons on my eyes and put cotton in my ears,
and drown out the maddening cries and hold back my tears?
