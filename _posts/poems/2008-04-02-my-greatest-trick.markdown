sometimes i wish i would just face that fear,
but don't we all have our bones to pick?
though sometimes i wish i could just disappear,
would that not be my greatest trick?

but i want to be here, there's much to see,
moments i have not yet met.
i think if i would just share more of me,
that would be my greatest effect.
