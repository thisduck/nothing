i did not see the stars tonight
i blamed the city, i blamed the light
i blamed the weather, i blamed the fog
i blamed pollution, and i blamed the smog

i thought, where did we all go so wrong?
i thought, maybe i should write a sad song.
i thought, oh lord, why is the world so stuck-up?
but, in fact: i did not see the stars, because i did not look up
