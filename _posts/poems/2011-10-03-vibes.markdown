i have been waiting
for quite a while, but
those positive vibes
you said you'd send
never arrived.

those vibes aren't alive,
and even if they did arrive,
they'd be dead on arrival.
far beyond repair,
far beyond revival.

i think sending vibes is
a feel good thing -
for the sender.
do me a favour then,
put them on some shelf.
keep your vibes to yourself.

maybe next time you
can send me something
useful, like a set
of disposable pens.
